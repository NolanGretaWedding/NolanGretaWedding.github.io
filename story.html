              <p class="text-muted"><small>2014 — Harmony Middle School</small></p>
              <p>
                We first met in 2014 at Harmony Middle School. In 6th grade, we had three classes
                together (that we can remember): band, english, and history. In the summer of 2018,
                before the start of our sophomore year, we started hanging out more due to a shared
                friend group. Right before the start of the school year we began dating with a little
                sequence that kind of goes like this: "Will you go out with me?" "Sure" "Are you sure?" "Eh, why not?"
                Ladies and gentlemen, that's how it's done.

              <h2>First Date</h2>
              <p class="text-muted"><small>August 2018</small></p>
              <p>
                On our first date, we went tubing down the Potomac River. As all young couples are, we
                were fairly awkward. Things started to shift for the better when Nolan somehow got stuck
                in a tree in the middle of the river. Although it was slightly embarrassing, it helped break
                the ice and bit. Now, it is one of our favorite memories from our early days together.

              <h2>The proposal</h2>
              <p class="text-muted"><small>May 27, 2025 — Seneca Rocks, WV</small></p>
              <p>
                In 2023, we took a trip to Seneca Rocks, West Virginia for away in a small middle-of-nowhere cabin. On this trip,
                we had an unforgettable time and Seneca Rocks quickly became one of our favorite places. When our friend group planned
                a graduation camping trip near Seneca Rocks in May 2025, Nolan decided it was the perfect opportunity to propose. With the help
                of our friends, we managed to keep it a secret (sort of). On the morning of May 27th, we hiked up in the rain and Nolan proposed
                at the overlook. Although it was rainy, it still made for a beautiful and memorable moment. Thank you to all our friends, especiall Jett
                our photographer, who helped make it special!
